## About
**FexFetch** is a convenient way to find out information about your OS, I do not use neofetch, and other similar packages. FexFetch is entirely written in Javascript and is open source. You can install it on your PC and use it just like neofetch.

## Install
**1.** Copy the repository through the GitHub site or with the command `git clone https://github.com/Haloger7/fexfetch.git`. You can also download the npm package with the command `npm i -g fexfetch`
**NOTE: If you installed the package via npm, then you need to use the `fexfetch` command!**

**2.** Go to the package directory and launch the console.

**3.** Enter `node .` into the console.

### Requirements
In order for the package to work, you need [**Node.js**](https://nodejs.org/en/). We recommend using the latest available LTS version.
