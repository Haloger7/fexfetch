## About
**FexFetch** is a convenient way to find out information about your OS, I do not use neofetch, and other similar packages. FexFetch is entirely written in Javascript and is open source. You can install it on your PC and use it just like neofetch.

## Install
**1.** You download the npm package with the command `npm i -g fexfetch`

**2.** Run `fexfetch` command in your console.

### Requirements
In order for the package to work, you need [**Node.js**](https://nodejs.org/en/). We recommend using the latest available LTS version.
